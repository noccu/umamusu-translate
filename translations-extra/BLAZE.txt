Before me lies  A broken, shattered reality
I reach out to the sky  Wavering and falling down

This world -So BLACKNESS- dazzles me
(The mass you thought was hope  Is only weighing down on you
Let the recoil of your feet into the earth  Guide you to become a burning fire in the sky)

As it fades away  Everything becomes a mirage
I keep staring out at  The faintest glow  So far away from me

The dirt on my feet  Blending into flares of hope as I dash into tomorrow
So mesmerized  By all I ever longed for

I carry on wandering and struggling  In a never-ending labyrinth
Aah just when I lost sight of it  My hands reached out

A most radiant light  Rushing through the darkness
Why  This fire burns  So uncontainable inside me now
I'm just shouting out  "Be the proof that I existed here"
My soul is merely ablaze like a fiery star  Still burning on

This world -So GLORY- dazzles me
(The mass you thought was hope  Is only weighing down on you
Let the recoil of your feet into the earth  Guide you to become a burning fire in the sky)

Spreading through the dark is a certain ambivalence
Leading the way  Praying all the way  I keep moving on

A false courage rearing at  The patchwork sky up so high above
Deep down inside me  I feel a power welling up

In silence I  Fall down yet another branch  Within the canopy of time
Aah I'm crawling up towards a place  Far beyond the light

A most intense desire  Cutting through the darkness
Why  These feelings poor out  So unending inside me now
I'm trying to communicate  "I am standing right here"
I merely aim for the furthest ends of this earth  Still running on

The rising of the sun  My tear-stained field of sight  The air swirling with dust
An out of place nostalgia

All that I could hope for reduced into a single wish to become unbeatable
The monsters hiding in my heart bare their fangs
Carve me a path  BLAZE

Until the end's in sight…
When this radiating light  Outshines all of the dark
Deep in my heart  Through the burning pain  I reach out my hands
A most radiant light  Rushing through the darkness
Why  This fire burns  So uncontainable inside me now
I'm just shouting out  "Be the proof that I existed here"
My soul is merely ablaze like a fiery star  Still burning on

This world -So BRIGHTNESS- dazzles me
(The mass you thought was hope  Is only weighing down on you
Let the recoil of your feet into the earth  Guide you to become a burning fire in the sky)
