A future beheld in shimmering tears!


(Ticket) The daily down and up · The textbook I hold
Doesn't hold the answers that I seek
We all take one step at a time
(Biwa) A little like stepping up to the · start line one momentous day
(Biwa, Taishin) Passion, emotions deep below

(Ticket) A jolting sense of gravitas
(Taishin) Our glancing looks to the sides
(Taishin, Ticket) Don't stop now my friends
(All) I want to cultivate a heart that stands up to everything!

Yes! Running to our dreams and aspirations
Ahead of anyone, we resolutely dash
This moment has come now where · we can't miss a single blink
The spring of life wasn't meant for us  Only today
And more  Get over!
We will overcome
The sparkle in our tears' the light of tomorrow!

(Taishin) A sudden Flying Bird stings my vision
In the sky one drowsy p.m. class  See, outside our window
(Taishin, Ticket) Flying high there
(Ticket) Wishing I could live my life at the same height
(All) A little blinded by its strength

(Biwa) I don't want to have to think
(Taishin) About the weaker side of me
(Biwa, Taishin) Don't lose heart my friends
(All) We all share the same hate of losing between us

Try! Headwinds don't stop us running all the same
Aiming far into them, we sincerely Move
(Biwa) Lay all of our feelings out there
(All) And hope that it gets us there
Up the pace of our beating hearts  As far as it will
Believe in tomorrow!
(Taishin) There's no second chance
Our time to grow is now or never

(Ticket) We will always make a few mistakes
All this running has put our heads so far in the clouds...!
(Taishin) Don't let them prevent you (Biwa) From moving up ahead
(All) You'll always be right
If you just believe

We go...
Running to our dreams and aspirations
Ahead of anyone, enthusiastically dash
Don't you blink and miss this moment, etch it deep into yourself
Yes! Has spring come to us after all?  I might have known
And more  Get over!
All of our shining tears
Sparkling lights, sunrise to another day!
